This is an app created by a team from `Programowanie Zespołowe` at WMII UMK in Torun.

# A Bit of History

In 2013, the “programowanie zespołowe” team, consisting of Kamil Tomasiak, Przemysław Porbadnik, Dawid Skrzypczyński, and Mateusz Wieczorkowski, under the supervision of Błażej Zyglarski, developed an application called Magic Trains. The purpose of this app was to teach children programming.

The application received an award in the “programowania zespołowego” competition. Later, an attempt was made to release it on the AppStore under the name “Trains Project.” English-language help elements were added to the app (thanks to Monika Zalewska for the recordings). However, the paid version did not succeed.

In 2015, the application was handed over to the Fundacja Rozwoju Informatyki WMiI UMK (Foundation for the Development of Computer Science at WMII UMK). For some time, it allowed preschoolers to learn programming on this faculty. The continued development of the application involved Błażej Zyglarski, Jakub Przybysz, and Dawid Gołuński, and the app received several new features, including physics simulations.

In 2018, the application was open-sourced under the MIT license

Between 2015 and 2020, over 200 children aged 5-6 from Torun participated in workshops where they learned the basics of object-oriented programming thanks to Trains Project. It’s wonderful that the application contributed to developing programming skills from such a young age!
